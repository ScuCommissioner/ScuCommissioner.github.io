                        <p class="card-text">Week 3 is in the books and a whopping 9 teams are now 2-1! I am starting to think that this is going
                            to be one of the more competitive seasons we have. The playoff hunt should be a tight one in
                            which every win will count and every trade can potentially make or break a season. With that
                            being said, lets recap a couple trades!

                                    the better end of this deal. I personally don't see it that way. It's more of a toss
                                    up for me, with consistency slightly higher in Abdullah (GBR).</p>

                                <p>Hot damn this is an interesting trade. Brady for Nelson was just the type of move Trav had
                                    been looking for. Ben got a BIG upgrade at QB, lost a step at running back, and took
                                    a big hit at the WR position. Nice move picking up Watson though. If Brady can keep pace
                                    and Nelson stays healthy this is a win-win.</p>

                            Gotta give a nod to Tyler with the top spot. Back to back strong weeks and the cluster fuck of 2-1's make this an easy call.
                            Russel probably won't give you 30+ most weeks but when he does it's tough to beat, as Connor
                            just found out. Cook/Dez/Green/Montgomery is a strong foundation to build around.

                            This may be a case where it's nice you don't feel obligated to play a guy that really isn't performing
                            but you drafted high. I.e the Anthony Bennett. Anyway it's a strong team even if they have to

                            You could be 3-0.. as a team there is a lot of points to be scored. Unfortunately last week you left a bunch of them on the
                            bench.. Hopefully this one doesn't come back to bite you in the ass. Like I said earlier, every

                            Honestly, 5-10 is a tossup. There isn't a whole lot seperating those teams. Snaggz team kinda showed up and took a respectable
                            loss to the Kush Rockets. Cobb's injury displayed Jason's lack of depth (Doug Martin should help),
                            forcing him to make a decision. He chose wrong.. Never chose the Brown..

                            The boys shit the bed week 3 but I still like the makeup of this roster. Oaklands offense was no where to be found Sunday

                            In a season where TE's are brutal, Dan Man is rolling with 2 of em in the starting lineup and 3 of them on the roster! The
                            best part is that none of the 3 scored over 1 point. You may be wondering whatsup with the TE
                            watch and I think this is an appropriate time to address it since Dan loves TE's so much. Next
                            season I am going to propose eliminating the required TE position and create another Wr/Rb/Te
                            flex. There just are not enough TE's that score points consistently.

                            One Good Week started in the rankings higher, and kept getting bumped down. Last week was quite the showing and I would go
                            so far to say it may be 3-4 good weeks this season. The issue witht his squad is too many teammates.
                            It's never good to have 2 49ers on the same team.. 2 Patriot WR's isn't to bad but if either
                            team has a bad week then your team is pretty frucked.

                            Brady got you the W this week, and really that's all that matters at this point. But is this a championship roster? My guy
                            reaction is absolutely not, and I think Ben knows this and would guess that he is will continue
                            to have a fluid roster throughout the season. Lynch/Thomas as your core is rough in my book.

                            While Brando has some interesting pieces, I just can't get behind Jeffery/Tate being your 3rd and 4th best non-QB players.
                            Also, why the fuck do you think Tyrell Williams should be on your roster, much less in your starting
                            lineup? It takes an injury to every Chargers reciever for Williams to be worth anything (totally
                            possible).

                            Brutal loss for Connor this week, but he only has himself to blame. If you set the right lineup you walk away with your first

                            You put up 72 points this week and quite frankly that felt like an overachievment. The good news is the guys you traded for
                            kicked ass, bad news is the guys you drafted still sucked. Sure you've been injury riddled all
                            season (it's only week 3 and your second KICKER has gone on IR), but you had 8 guys score under
                            5 pts. Regardless of injuries.. that aint gunna cut it.
