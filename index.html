                            I learned how to whip one of these sites up a couple weeks ago and thought it would be kind of
                            cool for our Power Rankings. Hopefully I can evolve this thing into something a little more fun
                            but for now you get the rankings online! As always, I will be biased, rude and quick to remind
                            you of my <b>championship history</b>. Enjoy!</p>

                            Micheal Crabapple racked up the TD's last week and carried Jacox to a tight victory over Brandon. This roster should put
                            up enough points to win week in and week out, and has the potential to put up big numbers if

                            Erik and Chooch are sitting on quite the war chest of running backs. I wouldn't be shocked to see the Kareem Pies (awesome

                            enough on the roster to get excited about. Mike Evans started well and Alshon will have weeks.
                            Other then that we have Kirk and Fournette, not sure that's gonna get it done in the long run.

                            Similar to Brandon, I think Dave and Coulter will need to make a move or they may be sitting just outside the playoffs. Sadly

                            Speaking of TuTu.. In a TE depleted league connor is sitting on 3 of them! Why the fuck do you have 3 Tight Ends?? Trade
                            one of those damn tight ends! I'm starting god damn Austin HOOOOOPER every week, and I know I

                            I'm gonna be salty if Peter out sucks Trav for the TuTu. This team may honeslty go winless. Probably not with LeVeon but
                            it's may going to be close. You called my draft review biased cuz I said this roster sucked,
                            can I be biased and right? I think I might be..
