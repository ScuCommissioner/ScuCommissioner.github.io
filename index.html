                            Ahh shit it's Week 11. Reminder: Trade Deadline is Nov. 25!</p>

                            Like it's gonna matter... no one seems to be insterested in trading anyway. It's been a few weeks since I put a power rankings
                            together. Last time I did this, Aaron Rodgers still had 2 collarbones, Dan Man was riding first
                            place, and Brando had the worst luck in fantasy.

                            To be honest, while this season has produced a league that has never been tighter.. there really has not been that many note
                            worthy things that have happened. Ben and Trav did a trade. Brandon can't win regardless of the
                            number of points he he scores. Other then that, the biggest story of the season is a Schmitt
                            coached team at the top of the standings. Don't see that everyday!

                            won the championship! The commish took home his first championship after going 10-3 in the inagural

                            Truth is, Alvin Kamara might be MVP on this team. Another truth, as Jim Pete loves to say to bring up, law of averages. Now,
                            I haven't crunched the numbers.. but I do feel like a few of the guys on this roster have overperformed
                            a bit. I also would really like to hate on a team that is fairly solid 1-9.

                            I want to say Jacox is in an envious position. Almost his entire bench can score as much as his starters. For the longest
                            time, Melvin Gordon was the dude you didn't have to worry about. But all of a sudden, the dude
                            scores sub 5 in 3/4 weeks and you have to start second guessing. I almost prefer my 7 for sure

                            <b>IF</b> Sammy Watkins managed to take half of the targets that went to Robert Woods, Connor would
                            probably be in the upper quarter of the standings.

                            This is a tough team to rank. Hunt/Ajayi/Howard are bell cow RB's that can score 20 a piece any week. Yet the Pies don't
                            seem to have enough fire power to pull out W's. Will this be a case study in RB vs WR? EZ and
                            Chooch are going to need some magic to stay out of the losers bracket.

                            TBH, I can't tell if Tyler has quit on the season or his team is legit bad. He DID start an Inactive player.. At the same
                            time, the injury bug has hit him pretty hard. BUT there hasn't been much action on his part to
                            get out of the shit hole, other then pick up a bunch of Giants. And in 2017 that ain't gonna

                            Talked to one of the higher ups in the Kush Rockets organization recently. Asked him about his teams tendency to drop starting

                            <br> His response was: "Yeah, I don't know what the fuck he is thinking."
