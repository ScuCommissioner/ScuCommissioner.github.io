                            Week 5 is in the books and somehow Dan Man has worked his way to 4-1 while Brando is 2nd in scoring sitting in last place.
                            Ain't this shit fun??

                            Other notable highlights from the last two weeks include O'Dell going out for the season, TE's continuing to not score points,
                            and Peter actually won twice. Jason's worst ever record is safe.

                            There hasn't been any trade action the last two weeks so let's take a minute to look at some history. Let's look at a number
                            that should make everyone pretty happy.<br>
                            <u>Regular Season Records of Former Champions:
                            </u><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>2012: 10-3</li>
                                <li>2013: 8-5</li>

                            </ul>
                            There you have it! With the exception of 2012 (total domination), 5-6 losses is a perfectly acceptable season! Your team
                            still has a chance! Anyway.. Let's get to it

                            2 Dolphins rolling in the starting lineup makes me feel wrong to be kinda high on this team. They've been pretty healthy
                            and Jay Ajayi hasn't been productive at all but they have been able to manage. If Mariota turns
                            it around there isn't much of a weakspot, except maybe the dolphins offense.

                            week and your probably telling yourselves "It's okay, that's a tough Seahawks D, he'll bounce

                            Bet Jordan would really like to start Crabtree of DeSean instead of Hunter Henry, who somehow got picked up for less then
                            Ed Dickson. Jordan is fairly deep with talent, his bench has been scoring alot of points. They
                            have actually outscored your starting lineup in both your losses and posted good number last
                            week. This is a prime team to make a trade, lets see a little action people!

                            Benny has yet to crack triple digits. Which could turn out to be trouble down the line, points are gonna be a tie breaker

                            I'd say sucks to suck but you really haven't. I feel like it's pretty typical for you to get alot of points against you for
                            some reason but dude <b>530</b> is 110+ points more then anyone has
                            scored on them. That's unreal, You should probably be even higher on this list. Fournette is
                            a tank, Evans is solid and you have a the top scoring TE. I bet this shit has been pretty frustrating..

                            So did you guys know that Dak Prescott is actually a pretty good fantasy QB? I for one, did not. Connor has been riding quality
                            Dak performances, and could easily be 3-2. I believe he's one of a handful of teams to not have
                            a sub 60 points week on the season. He's also rolling with an interesting management strategy,
                            I'm not sure where you came up leaving the kicker and defense spots open till gameday idea but
                            sometimes you just gotta try something different.

                            Kush Rockets have been real up and down this season. I knew Amari Cooper was struggling, I did not realize just how much
                            that struggle had been. 17.8 pts on the season, you'd think he played TE. The Raider combo that
                            was so threatining on paper hasn't really panned out. Speaking of not panning out, <b>Tarik Cohen</b>                            has been good. El. Oh. El.

                            Joe Mixon is coming into form, pairing him with Julio/Hogan/Hyde should keep the Degenerates competitive. Speaking of degenerates,
                            what's the wager on the matchup with the Kush Rockets this week? How confident are you in Mitchel

                            Snaggz has scored less points every week since week one. That's not a great trend. I bet Jacox would be interested in Antonio
                            Brown, just thinking outloud. Is Doug Matrin here to save your season? Probably not. I'll say
                            that this is a big week for Jason, if you don't post a decent number and turn things around with
                            a win, your going to have an uphill climb to make the playoffs. Can't let that 3 game losing
                            streak extend too much longer.

                            Props for getting two wins, Cam and LeVeon have really picked up the slack for you. That being said you still have Eddie
                            Lacy (8.3 pts on the season), which I find very interesting. AP won't be ready to play this week,
                            you don't have a defense or TE that can play this week. So while I applaud the effort in working
                            the waiver wire and getting a couple wins, there's still lots of work to do. Unless your content
                            with not being the worst team ever. How the fuck did Snaggz only win one game in a season?!
